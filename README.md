# Visual_Tracking_BCI
The GitHub repository contains the online system code derived from the 'visual tracking brain-computer interface' research. This code encompasses fixed visual tracking tasks, random visual tracking tasks, painting application, and snake game. 
These systems operate in conjunction with stimulus programs and processing programs. Specifically, Snake and visual_tracking_online correspond to a discrete version of visual tracking BCI, while VTBCI_fixed, VTBCI_rn&app, and VTBCI_sync correspond to the latest synchronized version of visual tracking BCI.
Regrettably, the comments within the code are currently predominantly in Chinese and are not yet complete and clear. We are actively working on further supplementing and improving them. If you come across any minor errors in the code, we encourage you to reach out to us. Given that we are not professional programming engineers, there may be some redundancy in the system or potential for better implementation methods. Your suggestions and advice are welcomed and appreciated.
